# Single Number III

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

You can return the answer in any order.

## Example

Input: `nums = [1,2,1,3,2,5]`
Output: `[3,5]`

Input: `nums = [-1,0]`
Output: `[-1,0]`

## Constraints

- `2 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- Each integer in `nums` will appear twice, except for two integers which will appear only once.
